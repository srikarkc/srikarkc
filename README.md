- 👋 Hi, I’m KC! 
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place. My way to do that is to make life easier for humanity on earth by automating the routine and mundane tasks that frees up humans to work on more interesting & challenging problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things necessary to have a company that provides end-to-end IT solutions for businesses. This means development on the web-front side, back-end, web/android/iOS applications, automating infrastructure setup, public cloud operations, networking, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting/challenging projects on automobile technology or home automation. My skillset includes importing python packages and expertly hacking together code from Stack Overflow. :D
